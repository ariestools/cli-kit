# Development Standards

This skill defines foundational development practices. Load the relevant sub-topic based on your current task:

**Skill identity.** This skill's version is exposed in this file's frontmatter under `metadata.version`. When reporting which skills informed your work, format as `<skill-name> v<version>` (e.g. `xy-development v1.1.19`). When multiple skills from this plugin are active, each may be listed.

## Table of Contents

### [TypeScript Conventions](typescript.md)
Read when writing, reviewing, or refactoring TypeScript code. Covers strictness posture, the `any` escape hatch policy, return type inference, interface vs type usage, and naming conventions.

### [Git Workflow](git.md)
Read when creating commits, branches, or preparing changes for review. Covers conventional commits, atomic commit discipline, and branch naming patterns.

### [Testing Principles](testing.md)
Read when writing tests, discussing test strategy, or evaluating coverage. Covers framework-agnostic testing principles. Note: specific test frameworks and tooling are defined in the XY Toolchain skill (Layer 2).

### [Development Workflow](workflow.md)
Read before running any build, lint, or test command, and before declaring any task complete. Covers native toolchain discovery (use the repo's commands, not ad-hoc one-offs) and the definition of done checklist.
